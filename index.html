        <p>Hello, my name is Olivier Lauzon but everyone calls me Ollie. I live in Orleans but I was born in Cornwall. Iâ€™m a student at Algonquin College for Interactive Media Design; I completed Music, Media and Film Foundations last year and decided to pursue a similar avenue. Ultimately my goal is to work from home. I enjoy web development and video editing, I would love to turn my two passions into an income. My biggest achievement would simply be following my own flow and allowing myself to dictate how I want to live my life; otherwise it would be my current work as a Dog Sitter.</p>
